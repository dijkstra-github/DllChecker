/**
 * Sad story of DLL Checker manager
 * 
 * It is deprecated. The end.
 * 
 * Long version: After major rework that has been done on DLL Checker this console application is no longer usable and will need tons of love.
 *               Since I'm the only one who knows about it but I'm leaving company soon I will just comment broken parts and leave it in perforce with DLL Checker.
 *               Otherwise it could be forgotten and since this was the only way of controlling PatternsDatabase it would be shame to lose it.
